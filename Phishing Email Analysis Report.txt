1) Email Metadata
From: "Amazon Account Security" <no-reply@amaz0n-security.com>
To: preethivarshala7@gmail.com
Subject: URGENT: Unauthorized Login Attempt Detected
Date: Mon, 20 Nov 2023 17:45:22 +0000

2) Detailed Findings
A] Suspicious Sender Address (Email Spoofing)
Claimed Identity: "Amazon Account Security"

Actual Sender Domain: amaz0n-security.com
Red Flag: Uses a zero (0) instead of an "o" to mimic amazon.com.
Legitimate Amazon Domains: amazon.com, amazonpay.com, amazonaws.com.
Fake Domain Registered? Check via "WHOIS" Lookup.

B] Email Header Analysis
SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
Result: neutral
Meaning: The senderâ€™s IP (192.0.2.123) is neither explicitly allowed nor denied.
Expected for Amazon: pass (since Amazon has strict SPF records).

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
Result: pass
But: The domain is fake (amaz0n-security.com).
Tactic: Attackers sometimes sign fake emails to appear legitimate.

IP Address
Sender IP: 192.0.2.123
Red Flag: Part of the TEST-NET-1 range (reserved for documentation, not real servers).
Legitimate Amazon IPs: Belong to AWS ranges (e.g., 52.94.x.x, 54.240.x.x).

C] Content Analysis (Social Engineering Tactics)
1. Urgent Language (Psychological Pressure)
Phrases Used:
"URGENT: Unauthorized Login Attempt Detected"
"secure your account immediately"
"temporarily restricted access"

Goal: Panic the victim into clicking without thinking.

2. Fake Login Link
URL: http://amaz0n-security-verify.com/account/login?id=123456789
Red Flags:
Domain: amaz0n-security-verify.com (not amazon.com).
HTTP (Not HTTPS): No encryption (data can be intercepted).
Hover Test: The displayed text may hide the real URL.

3. Generic Greeting
"Dear Customer" (instead of your real name).
Amazon always personalizes emails (e.g., "Dear [Your Name]").

4. Fake Amazon Branding
Logo Source: http://amaz0n-security.com/images/logo.png
Red Flags:
Hosted on a fake domain.
Uses HTTP (no padlock icon in browser).

5. Unusual Activity Claim
"Login from Berlin, Germany (IP: 203.0.113.45)"
IP Check: 203.0.113.45 is a reserved IP (used in examples, not real traffic).


3) Conclusion: Phishing Confirmed
This email is a phishing attempt due to:
*Domain Spoofing (amaz0n-security.com).
*Suspicious Headers (SPF: neutral, fake DKIM).
*Urgency + Fake Link (to steal credentials).
*Technical Inconsistencies (TEST-NET IP, HTTP logo).

Recommended Actions:
*Do NOT click any links.
*Report to Amazon: Forward to stop-spoofing@amazon.com.
*Check Legit Notifications: Always log in via amazon.com (not email links).
